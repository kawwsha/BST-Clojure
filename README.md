# BST-Clojure
Binary Search Tree Poster Project (in clojure and java). Includes several introductory clojure resources.


#Roadmap

1. Learn mutable structures in Clojure 
  (lisp vectors usually immutable)

2. Learn implementing LinkedLists

3. Then learn Binary Search trees implementations in lisp

4. Then write out Red-Black Tree and / or AVL in Java then port to Clojure 

5. Finally begin to test each data structure for N-gram creation, node search, insertion, and deleting. Create Benchmarks and determine if certain texts cause more rebalancing.
